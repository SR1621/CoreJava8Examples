 Kuberantes is container managment tool 
 
 Container -->Pods -->Node -->Cluster 
 
 service is going to connectt betwen pods 
 Service is going to handle the Load balancer urls also 
 
 Deployments are kuberanates objects that uare used for managing pods 
 
  kubetcl create deployment first-deployment image=<Docker-Image-Name>--port=8080 --replicas=4
 
 you can scale your applicaiton by increasing he numboe or running pids and update the running applicaiton using deployment objects 
 
 secret and config map 
 password  can be stored in secret and plain test can be stored in config map  
 
  kuberantes uses etcd as a key lavalu edatabas store 
 it stores all the configuraiton of the kubernates cluster in etcd 
 it stores all the secret and configmap data inside the etcd database 
 
 max limt is 1 mb to store secrets 
 
 Master node -- > Worker node (n) --Pods(n)

Cluster is nothing orgainzaiton

Master Node 
API Server  (Kubectl get nods or kubectl get pods )
Scheduler will take the decision based on the load of the worker node and availability 
Controll manager  --will cehck the status of the workder node and if the pod crashes and it immidealty informs the to schedule and take the decision (Node controller ,replcaiton controller ,endpoints controller and service account & Token controller )

ETCD --all infofmation of nods and pods are stored in database  
Workder node 

Kublet (kublet is an agent running on each node and kublet communicate with master node using API Server )
it defines pod spec .A podspec is a yaml or JSON Object that describes about your pods .
Kube PRoxy (is a network agent which runs on each node and it is responsible for maintaing network configuratin and rules 
Container runtime --a container runtime ,also known as container engiine and it helps to run container insdie pods

ElasticCache overview is used for caching mecahsnism  Redis or Memcached
Redis, an in-memory data structure store, offers several advantages, including high performance through fast data access, scalability via clustering, and data persistence options, making it suitable for caching, session management, and real-time applications.
